abstract="Accurate forecasts of macroeconomic variables are crucial inputs into the decisions of economic agents and policy makers. Exploiting inherent aggregation structures of such variables, we apply forecast reconciliation methods to generate forecasts that are coherent with the aggregation constraints. We generate both point and probabilistic forecasts for the first time in the macroeconomic setting. Using Australian GDP we show that forecast reconciliation not only returns coherent forecasts but also improves the overall forecast accuracy in both point and probabilistic frameworks.",

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of Temporal Hierarchies for time series forecasting. A temporal hierarchy can be constructed for any time series by means of non-overlapping temporal aggregation. Predictions constructed at all aggregation levels are combined with the proposed framework to result in temporally reconciled, accurate and robust forecasts. The implied combination mitigates modelling uncertainty, while the reconciled nature of the forecasts results in a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different planning horizons: from short-term operational up to long-term strategic planning. The proposed methodology is independent of forecasting models. It can embed high level managerial forecasts that incorporate complex and unstructured information with lower level statistical forecasts. Our results show that forecasting with temporal hierarchies increases accuracy over conventional forecasting, particularly under increased modelling uncertainty. We discuss organisational implications of the temporally reconciled forecasts using a case study of Accident & Emergency departments.}
